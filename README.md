# count lines
=====================================================

**Introduction**
---------------

This code counts the total number of lines of code in a given open-source project. It can be used to count lines of code in projects such as the Linux kernel or other software repositories.

**C Version**
-------------

### count_loc.c

Count lines of code in a given repository.

### Compile and Run
```bash
gcc count_loc.c -o count_loc
./count_loc
```

**Rust Version**
--------------

### lcounter.rs

Count lines of code in a given repository.

### Compile and Run
```bash
rustc lcounter.rs
./lcounter
```

**Count Rust Lines**
-------------------

### countrust.c
This is only dor knowing how much rust code is there in a perticular project.
Count Rust lines of code in a given repository.

### Compile and Run
```bash
gcc countrust.c -o countrust
./countrust
```

**Usage**
-----

1. Clone the repository you want to count lines of code for.
2. Run the corresponding executable (e.g. `./count_loc`, `./lcounter`, or `./countrust`).
3. Enter the path to the repository when prompted.
4. The total number of lines of code will be displayed.

**Note**
----

* Make sure to replace the `count_loc.c`, `lcounter.rs`, and `countrust.c` files with the actual code.
* This code is for demonstration purposes only and may not work for all repositories or file types.
